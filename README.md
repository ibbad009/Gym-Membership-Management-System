Welcome to the **Gym Membership Management System**! This is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows gyms to efficiently manage their members, including adding new members, updating their details, deleting members, and tracking attendance.

---

**Features**
- **Add New Members**: Add members with details like name, age, gender, contact information, and membership type (Monthly/Yearly).
- **View All Members**: Display a list of all gym members with their details.
- **Update Member Information**: Edit member details to keep records up-to-date.
- **Delete Members**: Remove members from the system when needed.
- **Track Attendance**: Record and view attendance for each member.

---

**Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js (with functional components and hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`).
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for building a RESTful API.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing member and attendance data.
- **Styling**: CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.
